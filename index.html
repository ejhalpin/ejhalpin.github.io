              Eugene Halpin began his professional career as a teacher, specializing in physics. Eugene's problem solving skills, innovative teaching methods,
              and ability to make personal connections made him a favorite among students and coworkers alike. While teaching, Eugene began mentoring high
              school robotics teams and coaching the kids on how to build and code robots. Though Eugene possesses the confidence and organizational skills to
              manage large groups of people, he is also a natural problem-solver with the capability to excel at detailed, technical work. Eugene taught himself
              Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a hobby.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Eugene’s spare time, he does woodwork. He is a master craftsman and his patience and attention to detail make his projects beautiful. He
              especially loves crafting large pieces of gorgeous furniture that are close to impossible to move.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eugene has an amazing sense of humor and is particularly good at weaving stories together. His brand of weird is a delight that will leave you
              guffawing and clawing your face for more. He spent a number of years as a dungeon master for various games of D&D, and emerged unscathed and
              handsome as ever.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eugene lives with his perfect daughter and kickass wife in Wendell, NC and is looking for challenging work with plenty of opportunities for growth
              and advancement. He likes money, too.
