      Eugene Halpin began his professional career as a teacher, specializing in physics. Eugene's problem solving
      skills,
      innovative teaching methods, and ability to make personal connections made him a favorite among students and
      coworkers alike.
      While teaching, Eugene began mentoring high school robotics teams and coaching the kids on how to build and
      code robots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Eugene possesses the confidence and organizational skills to manage large groups of people, he is
      also a natural
      problem-solver with the capability to excel at detailed, technical work. Eugene taught himself Java, HTML,
      CSS, and Javascript as a hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Eugeneâ€™s spare time, he does woodwork. He is a master craftsman and his patience and attention to detail
      make his projects beautiful.
      He especially loves crafting large pieces of gorgeous furniture that are close to impossible to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene has an amazing sense of humor and is particularly good at weaving stories together. His brand of
      weird is a delight that will leave
      you guffawing and clawing your face for more. He spent a number of years as a dungeon master for various
      games of D&D, and emerged unscathed
      and handsome as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      To woo his future wife, Eugene confidently wrote a 5 page essay explaining his interest. He marched up to
      her, handed it to her, and waited
      patiently while she read it. When she was done reading, that was that. Love was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene lives with his perfect daughter and kickass wife in Wendell, NC and is looking for challenging work
      with plenty of opportunities for
      growth and advancement. He likes money, too.
    </p>
